# Create a function that given a list which represents street lights given
# as a parameter(l_street), determine if an outage has occurred.
# A street with a total number of "F" greater than or equal to 2 returns "Outage",
# anything below returns "Power"
# Example Input: [ 'T', 'F', 'F', 'F' ]             
# Example Output: "Outage"

    if lights.count('F') >= 2:
        return "Outage"
    else:
        return "Power"
